Generally, datasets with high entropy are preferred because there is less predictability, so the model won't be biased toward a specific feature. In the supervised learning lab, I learned entropy can be used to train a decision tree. The accuracy score for model trained on the lab dataset with entropy was 0.895 while the score for the mode trained on my data set was around 0.991. "
